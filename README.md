# ML-Bearing-Failure-Prediction
Project done for subject Introduction to Machine Learning.

It is about predicting time to failure for bearings, when we have some data about them.
# Dataset
Dataset is described in a pdf file.

# Content
What's in code?
1. Importing libraries
2. Setting up data paths
3. Pre-processing
4. Picking algorithm type
5. Useful functions
6. Output and predicting function

# Warnings
For 1st bearing as we can see there is no failure. (for dataset 1)

If you want to see result for other bearing (1-4) set variable "bearing" to other number.

I have not used 3rd dataset, because the data was not acceptable.
